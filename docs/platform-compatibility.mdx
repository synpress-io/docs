title: Platform Compatibility
---

Synpress v4 has the following platform and environment requirements:

**Operating Systems:**

*   **macOS:**  ✅ Fully Supported
*   **Linux:**  ✅ Fully Supported
*   **Windows:** ❌ Not Officially Supported.  [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) is recommended as a workaround.

**Node.js:**

*   Requires Node.js version 18 or higher (Node.js 20+ is recommended).
*   Synpress is now an ESM-only package. Don't use `require()` to import it, and make sure your nearest `package.json`
    contains `"type": "module"`.

**Testing Frameworks:**

*   **Playwright:** ✅ Fully Supported (requires Playwright >= 1.39.0)
*   **Cypress:** 🧪 Experimental Support.

**Browsers**:

*   **Chromium**: ✅ Fully Supported

**CI Providers:**

*   **GitHub Actions:** ✅ Officially Supported and tested.

While Synpress *may* work on other CI providers, we have not officially tested them.  If you encounter issues with a CI provider other than GitHub Actions, please report them on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/XhZKSRGtWc) or [GitHub](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synpress/issues).

**Important Notes for CI:**

*   Due to limitations with MetaMask and Phantom, running tests in headless mode on CI (especially GitHub Actions) requires special configuration.  You'll likely need to use a virtual display like `xvfb-run`.
*   Refer to the [CI Guide](/docs/guides/ci.md) for detailed instructions on setting up Synpress in your CI environment.

**Contributing to Windows Support:**

We are actively seeking contributors with experience in Windows development and Node.js to help expand Synpress compatibility. If you're interested, please connect with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/XhZKSRGtWc).
