Synpress is an E2E (End-to-End) testing library for Web3 dapps. It can be used with
both: [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).
Synpress is built with developer experience, stability, and performance in mind:

- **Developer Experience**: Type safety, simple API, comprehensive documentation, support for both Playwright and
  Cypress and all of their features.
- **Stability**: Complete test coverage, bullet-proof wallet integration API.
- **Performance**: Optimized for speed, parallelization, and fast feedback loops.
