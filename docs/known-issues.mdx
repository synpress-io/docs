## Playwright

Synpress and Playwright generally work well together. However, there are a couple of known limitations:

### Blank MetaMask Previews in Traces

When using Playwright's UI mode or the HTML reporter, previews of MetaMask tabs and popups within the traces will appear blank. This is a consequence of MetaMask's [LavaMoat](https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat) security policy, which restricts access to the extension's content in these contexts.  Unfortunately, there's no direct workaround within Synpress itself.

**Workarounds (if previews are *essential* for debugging):**

*   **Use Pre-built MetaMask without LavaMoat:** We have prepared a build of MetaMask without LavaMoat that you can use: https://github.com/synpress-io/metamask-extension/releases
*   **Build MetaMask from Source:** You can build a custom version of the MetaMask extension with LavaMoat disabled.  This is *not* recommended for general use or production, only for local debugging.  If you need assistance with this, reach out to the Synpress community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/XhZKSRGtWc).
*   **Use Headful Mode on CI and locally:** While not ideal for CI, running tests in headed mode (`playwright test` or `HEADLESS=false playwright test`) will allow you to observe the MetaMask UI directly during test execution, which can help with debugging.

## MetaMask

### Headless Mode Limitations on CI

MetaMask has known compatibility issues with running in headless mode on certain CI providers, including GitHub Actions. This is due to a bug within MetaMask itself, not within Synpress.

**Workaround:**

*   **Run in Headful Mode on CI:** The recommended solution is to run your Synpress tests in *headed* mode on CI. This typically requires configuring your CI environment to use a virtual display (e.g., `xvfb-run` on Linux). See the [CI documentation](/docs/guides/ci.md) for detailed instructions.

    ```yaml
    # Example (GitHub Actions):
    - name: Build cache
      run: xvfb-run npx synpress

    - name: Run E2E tests (headful)
      run: xvfb-run npx playwright test
    ```

**Note:** We are actively monitoring for updates from MetaMask that might resolve this headless mode limitation.

## Windows

Currently, Synpress does not officially support Windows. We recommend using [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) as a workaround.
